title: About me!
---

I am a Software Engineer from India. I am always very curious about new technologies and the things i dont understand. I like philosophy, physics and a bit of maths. I like to read books especially real life stories. In my free time you can find me building something or listening to my favourite music [playlist](https://goo.gl/DhL9S3).
