title: About me!
---

I am a Software Engineer from India. I love reading about new technologies and things that i dont understand. I love philosophy and a tiny bit of maths. In my free time you can find me build some useless things which i hope someone someday in some parallel universe will use it.

### About this blog

So i have started this blog to write about things that interests me alot and maybe it will include some philosophy and maybe tiny bit of interesting problem solving. Its mainly the `logs.md` of my everyday thoughts and experiences.

### About the content
