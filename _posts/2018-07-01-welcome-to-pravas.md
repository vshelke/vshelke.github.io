Hello Everyone,

I have started this blog to log my everyday thoughts and learnings in one place. This blog will also help me in tracking different versions of myself as i evolve and improve myself everyday. I will try to keep all my posts minimal, informative and interesting. The posts will mainly consist of different ideas, problems and interesting solutions. Also i love building new things from scratch so can expect a few tutorials or demos itself.

Thank you.
